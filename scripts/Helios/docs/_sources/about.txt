Helios is a Maya utility made by |Thibault Houdon| using |Python| and |PyQt|.
It allows you to execute hundreds of commands by typing them in a search bar.

Helios is free and developed in my spare time. If you have any suggestions or are experiencing
issues with Helios you can contact me at houdon.thibault@gmail.com
