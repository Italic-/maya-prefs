Changelog
=========

1.1.0 - 19 Septembre 2016
-------------------------

	**New Features**
	  * Better search algorithm.
	  * Ranks the commands you use the most higher in the list. So if you execute the 'Cube' command more often than the 'NURBS Cube', it will appear first.
	  * The last command you executed is now remembered by Helios and automatically shows up when you open it.
	  * Added support for 'Advanced' scripts (add -advanced after the name of the command to create an advanced version).

	**Bug Fixes**
	  * You can now start your search with any of the word of a command. Searching for 'Transformation' will therefore find 'Freeze Transformations' and 'Reset Transformations'.
	  * Added compatibility with Maya 2017 and Linux.

	**Changes**
	  * The commands are now listed as separate python scripts (previously they were all listed inside the same python file which quickly became really messy for longer scripts).


1.0.0 - 15 August 2016
----------------------

  * First release of Helios
