Manually
========

You can also install the files manually by moving the following files/folders in a folder of your choice:

.. image:: img/manually_01.jpg

Then you'll need to execute the following python code in order to run Helios.

.. code:: python

    import sys
    sys.path.append('PATH TO FOLDER')

    import Helios
    Helios.HeliosGUI()

Change the 'PATH TO FOLDER' by the folder where you moved the files.
