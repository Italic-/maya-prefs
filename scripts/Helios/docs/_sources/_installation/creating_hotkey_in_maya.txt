First open up the Hotkey Editor (Go to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Hotkey Editor).

Next, go to the Runtime Command Editor tab and click on New. Enter a Name and Description for the script and make sure the Language is set to Python.

Then simply paste the script you got from the installer into the field.

Finally, just assign any Hotkey you want to the command you created to make Helios pop-up.

And you're done! Now everytime you hit Shift + C (or any hotkey you assigned to the script)
Helios will pop-up.
