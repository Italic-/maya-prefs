# Italic's Maya preferences and scripts
Stores my Maya preferences and scripts

I hope to periodically (every week or month) update with what I have on disk to keep hotkeys, scripts and their versions as I develop my workflow in Maya.

I am primarily working in 2016[.5] and converting commands and hotkeys backwards.
