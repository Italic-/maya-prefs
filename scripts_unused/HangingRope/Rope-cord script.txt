"Rope / Cord Curve Generator for maya"

This Script is designed to help you generate believable looking 
hanging curves from and to multiple points, verts, components, 
tranforms or objects in the order you have them selected.
The script also has 2 randomizing attributes with sliders that
 give you control over consistency.

Some examples of what you would use this script for:
-Telephone pole wires
-Ropes
-Chain instancing curve 

Gui Description from the provided help documentation:


Usage:

1. “Weight Randomization”:

- This slider’s limits are from 0.0 - 10.0

- It gives the lowest point in each dip between points
 some randomization.

- Useful if you have even / consistent spacing and distance
 between your points and you want some variation in the way it looks..

2. “Attach Randomization”:

- This slider’s limits are from 0.0 - 5.0

- The sharp point at which the curve is “”attached” (not in real time)
 to an object, or transform, can be randomized to prevent overlap with
 multiple cord/ rope curves.

- This slider adds an offset in a random direction from the exact 
location of the point being sampled.

3. “Cord Weight”:

- This slider controls the overall “weight” of the coord, or how much
 it dips down between points. This works in conjunction with the
 “Weight Randomization” slider from the first bullet point.

- Negative values will cause rope to rise instead of sink.

4. “Generate”:

- This button generates the curve after any settings have been tweaked / set.

- At least 2 objects / transforms / components need to be selected or 
this will return an error.

5. “Revert to Selection”:

- This button will reselect the components you had selected before, 
in the order they were selected in to allow you to create multiple curves
 with the same settings.

- You must not select anything else prior to using this button, 
or it will not work, or will return



What this script does not do:

-There is no history, so moving the objects you created the curves from will not move the curves with them.
-Curve cv's are not evenly spaced, but a quick curve rebuild wil fix that.
-No components of this script will animate the curve, that will be up to the user after the curves are generated!
